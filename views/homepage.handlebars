<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>Once you are logged in, the webpage will take you to our Techbot section and there you will have a bot to help you with your most desired programming questions. Once you ask a question, the AI will respond to you as best it can. If you exit the page and log back it, the chat box will have a history of the answers. No need to worry about accidently exiting the page and losing your information.</p>

<h2>Future Development!</h2>
<p>We are working on adding more programming language responses. We are also working on deleting specific messages rather than the entire topic. We also want the developers to be able to change their password or add a forgot password section.</p>
